### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** 
    - Entertainment
- **Mobile:**
    - Uses real-time access and user-generated content (reviews/comments), but lacks unique mobile features like camera, location, or push notifications.
- **Story:**
    - Offers value by providing an accessible platform for movie enthusiasts to discuss films, but it may overlap with existing platforms (e.g., IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes).
- **Market:**
    - Large audience of movie lovers, but the space is competitive, requiring a unique feature to stand out.
- **Habit:**
    - Could encourage frequent interaction, especially around new movie releases, but engagement depends heavily on community activity.
- **Scope:**
